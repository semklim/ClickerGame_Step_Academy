# Clicker Game
## A task:
```
- create a game
- be sure to work through github
- don't forget to commit changes and download others' changes

requirements:
- different levels, go in a circle (or in random order)
- how and when the end of the game comes - you decide
- come up with 2 different mechanics
- action sounds (attack, etc.) + background music
- use observer and factory patterns
- use keyboard and mouse events (you can use 2 control options for the same actions)

necessarily:
- life (or an analogue of its mechanics) for the player
- attack from the player and enemies (or an analogue of this mechanic)
- transition between levels
- first-person element (hand, player's weapon or something like that) 
  with action animations (possible through gif)
```
